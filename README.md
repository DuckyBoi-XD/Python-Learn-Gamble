# Python-Learn-Gamble
The repo/project is based on learning how to code in python with a touch of experience and creating a game at the end to show my still (Gambling Game).

### As of for now this is my steps to successding this project:

1. Learn the basics on how to code
2. Make a small little game to show my understanding
3. Learn the more difficult parts on how to code
4. Try to make the gambling game
5. Make it better
6. Possibly make it into a Desktop game

### Working
1) My whole learning explanation is in my learn.py file but here I'm going to explain, and show my understanding on EVERY METHOD, FUNCTION etc.


2) I want to try to make a small simple game to show my understanding. I'm thinking of making a simgle shop where you can buy stuff or making a simpler gamble game like coin flip, dice roll, guess number or guess card.


3) Learning the difficult parts of th game is going to be conected with my 4th goal which is to make a gambaling game


4) My end projct is a gambaling game. Now I'm not really planning to create a new gambaling game so I'm going to just recreate gambaling games that there already is. For my game I'm planning to have a game where you can access all kind of gambaling games. For those games I'm planning to have: Blackjack, roulette, slots and ride the bus. If I can, I want to try to create some other games liks, poker, liar's dice and liar's deck. These games are more difficult because I would need to create a computor player or an AI or the player to verse (for make it connect to real life people but I ain't that good).
